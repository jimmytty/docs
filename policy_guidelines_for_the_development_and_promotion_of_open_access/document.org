** DONE FOREWORD

As stated in its Constitution, UNESCO is dedicated to "maintain, increase and diffuse knowledge". Therefore, part of its mission is to build knowledge societies by fostering universal access to information and knowledge through information and communication technologies (ICTs). The Knowledge Societies Division of the Communication and Information Sector is engaged in promoting multilingualism in cyberspace, access to information for people with disabilities, developing national policies for the information society, preservation of documentary heritage, and use of ICTs in education, science and culture, including Open Access to scientific information and research. Open Access is at the heart of the overall effort by the Organization to build peace in the minds of men and women.

Through Open Access, researchers and students from around the world gain increased access to knowledge, publications receive greater visibility and readership, and the potential impact of research is heightened. Increased access to, and sharing of knowledge leads to opportunities for equitable economic and social development, intercultural dialogue, and has the potential to spark innovation. The UNESCO Open Access strategy approved by the Executive Board in its 187th session and further adopted by the 36th General Conference identified up-stream policy advice to Member States in the field of Open Access as the core priority area amongst others. These policy guidelines are the result of an iterative process undertaken by the UNESCO Secretariat and Dr. Alma Swan, a leading expert in the field of Open Access, to revise the preliminary report based on the online consultation undertaken in the Open Access Community of the WSIS Knowledge Communities for peer review in September 2011.

I believe that this comprehensive document will be broadly useful to decision- and policy-makers at the national and international levels. However, it should be stressed that they are meant to be strictly advisory; they are not intended as a prescriptive or normative instrument. Further, I hope that this publication will also serve as a reference point for all stakeholders to clarify basic doubts in the field of Open Access. I encourage you to provide us your feedback and comments based on your experience of applying the ideas covered in this publication to further improve it in future editions.

** DONE INTRODUCTION [100%]
*** DONE Open Access to Scientific Information and Research

Scientific information is both a researcher's greatest output and technological innovation's most important resource. Open Access (OA) is the provision of free access to peer-reviewed, scholarly and research information to all. It requires that the rights holder grants worldwide irrevocable right of access to copy, use, distribute, transmit, and make derivative works in any format for any lawful activities with proper attribution to the original author. Open Access uses Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to increase and enhance the dissemination of scholarship. OA is about Freedom, Flexibility and Fairness.

The rising cost of journal subscription is a major force behind the emergence of the OA movement. The emergence of digitisation and Internet has increased the possibility of making information available to anyone, anywhere, anytime, and in any format. Through Open Access, researchers and students from around the world gain increased access to knowledge, publications receive greater visibility and readership, and the potential impact of research is heightened. Increased access to and sharing of knowledge leads to opportunities for equitable economic and social development, intercultural dialogue, and has the potential to spark innovation. Open Access is at the heart of UNESCO's goal to provide universal access to information and knowledge, focussing particularly on two global priorities: Africa and Gender equality. In all the work UNESCO does in the field of OA, the overarching goal is to foster an enabling environment for OA in the Member States so that the benefits of research are accessible to everyone through the public Internet.

*** DONE UNESCO and Open Access [100%]

The Constitution of United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in Article I, Clause 2 states one of the purposes and functions of the Organisation as:

(c) Maintain, increase and diffuse knowledge: By assuring the conservation and protection of the world's inheritance of books, works of art and monuments of history and science, and recommending to the nations concerned the necessary international conventions;

    By encouraging cooperation among the nations in all branches of intellectual activity, including the international exchange of persons active in the fields of education, science and culture and the exchange of publications, objects of artistic and scientific interest and other materials of information;

    By initiating methods of international cooperation calculated to give the people of all countries access to the printed and published materials produced by any of them.

While UNESCO's mission is to contribute to the building of peace, the eradication of poverty, sustainable development and intercultural dialogue through education, the sciences, culture, communication and information, the Organisation has the following five overarching objectives:

  + Attaining quality education for all and lifelong learning.

  + Mobilising science knowledge and policy for sustainable development.

  + Addressing emerging social and ethical challenges.

  + Fostering cultural diversity, intercultural dialogue and a culture of peace.

  + Building inclusive knowledge societies through information and communication.

The organisation also has two global priorities -- Africa and Gender Equality within its overall mandate, as areas of focus. Thus, in the areas of its competence, UNESCO's role is to improve access to information and knowledge for the Member States through appropriate use of information and communication technologies. While the programme sectors engage in the specific area of UNESCO's competence, the Communication and Information sector, especially the Knowledge Societies Division (KSD) engages in creating an enabling environment in Member States to facilitate access to information and knowledge in order to build inclusive knowledge societies. Open Access to scientific information and research is one of the many programmes on which the KSD works to increase access to information and knowledge. Some of the other related areas where UNESCO works are:

**** DONE Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)

In the area of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), UNESCO fulfils its basic functions of a laboratory of ideas and a standard-setter to forge universal agreements on emerging ethical issues by supporting the development and use of open, interoperable, non-discriminatory standards for information handling and access as important elements in developing effective infostructures that contribute to democratic practices, accountability and good governance. Recognising that software plays a crucial role in access to information and knowledge, UNESCO supported the development and distribution of software such as the Micro CDS/ISIS[fn:1] (information storage and retrieval software) and Greenstone[fn:2] (digital library software). FOSS is the engine for the growth and development of Open Access, and UNESCO encourages community approaches to software development.

**** DONE Preservation of Digital Heritage

Preservation of digital cultural heritage, including digital information is a priority area for UNESCO. Digital preservation consists of the processes aimed at ensuring the continued accessibility of digital materials. Making information that are preserved accessible to citizens is facilitated through the appropriate use of a combination of software and hardware tools. UNESCO's Charter on the Preservation of the Digital Heritage (2003) states that "the purpose of preserving the digital heritage is to ensure that it remains accessible to the public. Accordingly, access to digital heritage materials, especially those in the public domain, should be free of unreasonable restrictions. At the same time, sensitive and personal information should be protected from any form of intrusion".

UNESCO's Memory of the World (MoW) programme aims at preserving world's documentary heritage by making it permanently accessible to all without hindrance. The mission of the Memory of the World Programme is:

  + To facilitate preservation, by the most appropriate techniques, of the world's documentary heritage.

  + To assist universal access to documentary heritage.

  + To increase awareness worldwide of the existence and significance of documentary heritage.

**** DONE Open Educational Resources

Access to high quality education is key to the building of peace, sustainable social and economic development, and intercultural dialogue. Open Educational Resources (OER) provide a strategic opportunity to improve access to quality education at all levels, and increase dialogue, knowledge sharing and capacity building. In the education and research ecosystem, OER and OA forms two important interventions that works in an integrated fashion to promote the quality of learning and generate new knowledge. The term OER was coined at UNESCO in the 2002 Forum on the Impact of Open Courseware for Higher Education in Developing Countries.

**** DONE Information for All Programme (IFAP)

KSD also hosts the intergovernmental programme -- Information for All Programme (IFAP) that is engaged in reducing the gap between information have and have not in North and South. The IFAP seeks to:

  + promote international reflection and debate on the ethical, legal and societal challenges of the information society;

  + promote and widen access to information in the public domain through the organisation, digitisation and preservation of information;

  + support training, continuing education and lifelong learning in the fields of communication, information and informatics;

  + support the production of local content and foster the availability of indigenous knowledge through basic literacy and ICT literacy training;

  + promote the use of international standards and best practices in communication, information and informatics in UNESCO's fields of competence; and

  + promote information and knowledge networking at local, national, regional and international levels.

**** DONE World Summit on the Information Society

The World Summit on the Information Society[fn:3] (WSIS), Geneva (2003) declared that "the ability for all to access and contribute information, ideas and knowledge is essential in an inclusive Information Society". It further emphasised that sharing of global knowledge for development can be enhanced by removing barriers to equitable access to information. While a rich public domain is an essential element for the growth of the Information Society, preservation of documentary records and free and equitable access to scientific information is necessary for innovation, creating new business opportunities and provide access to collective memory of the civilizations.
In the context of Open Access, the Summit proclaimed:

28. We strive to promote universal access with equal opportunities for all to scientific knowledge and the creation and dissemination of scientific and technical information, including open access initiatives for scientific publishing.

Two of the Action Lines of the WSIS (Action Line 3: Access to information and knowledge and Action Line 7: E-Science) have been involved in promoting Open Access to peer-reviewed information and research data through their interventions and engagements with the stakeholders.

*** DONE Objective of this Document

The overall objective of the Policy Guidelines is to promote Open Access in Member States by facilitating understanding of all relevant issues related to Open Access. Specifically, it is expected that the document shall:

  + Enable Member State institutions to review their position on access to scientific information in the light of the Policy Guidelines;

  + Assist in the choice of appropriate OA policy in the specific contexts of Member States; and

  + Facilitate adoption of OA policy in research funding bodies and institutions by integrating relevant issues in the national research systems.

Thus, the Policy Guidelines are not prescriptive in nature, but are suggestive to facilitate knowledge-based decision- making to adopt OA policies and strengthen national research systems.

*** DONE Organisation of the Contents [100%]

The content of the Policy Guidelines is organized in to nine sections:

  + Section 1: The Development of Open Access to Scientific Information and Research, gives an overview of the definitions used, and the history of the OA movement -- Budapest -- Bethesda -- Berlin.

  + Section 2: Approaches to Open Access, enumerates the "green" and "gold" routes to OA.

  + Section 3: The Importance of Open Access, explains how OA is important for scholars, research institutions and for developing knowledge societies.

  + Section 4: The Benefits of Open Access, emphasizes that OA enhances research process, improves visibility and usage of research works, and therefore, the impact of research works is also increased through citations and impact outside the academia.

  + Section 5: Business Models, analyses the traditional business models in scientific communications and describes the new emerging models in the context of OA.

  + Section 6: Copyright and Licensing, provides an overview of the legal issues in a non-legal language to explain that copyright is at the heart of OA. Copyright owners consent is essential to make OA happen, and authors and creators can retain rights to increase use of their works through different mechanisms, including Creative Commons licensing.

  + Section 7: Strategies to Promote Open Access, describes policy- focused, advocacy-based and infrastructural approaches to OA. While all the approaches are important, it also lists a number of organizations engaged in promoting OA.

  + Section 8: Policy Framework for Open Access, presents an overview of the growth of policies, and a critical appraisal of the issues affecting OA policies. It also presents a typology of OA policies to explain the difference in different types of policies adopted around the world. The chapter should be seen along-with the examples in Appendix-1.

  + Section 9: Summary Policy Guidelines, is the key section of this document and explain the various components that a standard policy should consider, and suggests the best policy decision to be included. This section should also be seen along-with the templates in Appendix-2.

The Policy Guidelines also gives a detailed bibliography and glossary of terms and abbreviations used at the end. An executive summary is also there in the beginning to provide an overview of the document to help a quick understanding, though it is recommended that you read the sections for detail.

**** DONE Using the Policy Guidelines

The Policy Guidelines can be used by individuals as a basic text on Open Access and related policies. While we recommend that beginners to the world of Open Access should read it from cover to cover, people having some understanding of OA may like to start reading from any of the sections. Decision-makers, administrators and research managers should focus on Sections 8 and 9 that capture all relevant issues of OA policy development. At the end of this document, you will find examples of different types of OA policies (Appendix 1), and three policy templates (Appendix 2) to choose and adopt. While every institution may have their unique process of policy adoption, we recommend a more democratic, consultative and open approach to adopt Open Access policy, as success of the policy implementation will depend on the ownership of the stakeholders to deposit their work and/or publish in OA journals. We are sure that the Policy Guidelines will be useful to you, and we are interested in listening to your experiences and feedback. Please fill the attached feedback form at page 75-76 and return it to us to help improve the Policy Guidelines and also share your experiences with others.

** DONE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

These Guidelines provide an account of the development of Open Access, why it is important and desirable, how to attain it, and the design and effectiveness of policies. Open Access is a new way of disseminating research information, made possible because of the World Wide Web. The development of the concept is summarised as follows:

  + The Web offers new opportunities to build an optimal system for communicating science -- a fully linked, fully interoperable, fully-exploitable scientific research database available to all.

  + Scientists are using these opportunities both to develop Open Access routes for the formal literature and for informal types of communication.

  + For the growing body of Open Access information, preservation in the long-term is a key issue.

  + Essential for the acceptance and use of the Open Access literature are new services that provide for the needs of scientists and research managers.

  + There are already good, workable, proven-in-use definitions of Open Access that can be used to underpin policy.

  + There is also a distinction made between two types of Open Access -- gratis and libre -- and this distinction also has policy implications.

  + Two practical routes to Open Access ("green" and "gold") have been formally endorsed by the research community.

  + The primary, and original, target for Open Access was the journal literature (including peer-reviewed conference proceedings). Masters and doctoral theses are also welcome additions to this list and the concept is now being widened to include research data and books.

There is already considerable infrastructure in place to enable Open Access although in some disciplines this is much further advanced than others. In these cases, cultural norms have changed to support Open Access. Open Access is achieved by two main routes:

  + Open Access journals, the "gold" route to Open Access, are a particularly successful model in some disciplines, and especially in some geographical communities.

  + The "green" route, via repositories can capture more material, faster, if the right policies are put in place.

Additionally, "hybrid" Open Access is offered by many publishers: this is where a fee can be paid to make a single article Open Access in an otherwise subscription-based journal. In some cases, the publisher will reduce the subscription cost in line with the new revenue coming in from Open Access charges, but in most cases this is not offered. The practice of accruing new revenue from Open Access charges without reducing the subscription price is known as "double dipping".

There are a number of issues that contribute to the importance of Open Access:

  + There is a problem of accessibility to scientific information everywhere.

  + Levels of Open Access vary by discipline, and some disciplines lag behind considerably, making the effort to achieve Open Access even more urgent.

  + Access problems are accentuated in developing, emerging and transition countries.

  + There are some schemes to alleviate access problems in the poorest countries but although these provide access, they do not provide Open Access: they are not permanent, they provide access only to a proportion of the literature, and they do not make the literature open to all but only to specific institutions.

  + Open Access is now joined by other concepts in a broader "open" agenda that encompasses issues such as Open Educational Resources, Open Science, Open Innovation and Open Data.

  + Some initiatives aimed at improving access are not Open Access and should be clearly differentiated as something different.

The benefits of Open Access are summarised as follows:

  + Open Access improves the speed, efficiency and efficacy of research.

  + Open Access is an enabling factor in interdisciplinary research.

  + Open Access enables computation upon the research. literature.

  + Open Access increases the visibility, usage and impact of research.

  + Open Access allows the professional, practitioner and business communities, and the interested public, to benefit from research.

As Open Access has grown, new business models have been developed -- for journal publishing, for Open Access repositories, book publishing and services built to provide for new needs, processes and systems associated with the new methods of dissemination.

The dissemination of research depends upon the copyright holder's consent and this can be used to enhance or hamper Open Access. Copyright is a bundle of rights: authors of journal articles normally sign the whole bundle of rights over to the publisher, though this is not normally necessary.

Authors (or their employers or funders) can retain the rights they need to make the work Open Access, assigning to the journal publisher the right to publish the work (and to have the exclusive right to do this, if required). Such premeditated retention of sufficient rights to enable Open Access is the preferable course of action rather than seeking permission post-publication.

Formally licensing scientific works is good practice because it makes clear to the user -- whether human or machine -- what can be done with the work and by that can encourage use. Only a minor part of the Open Access literature is formally licensed at present: this is the case even for Open Access journal content.

Creative Commons licensing is best practice because the system is well-understood, provides a suite of licences that cover all needs, and the licences are machine-readable. In the absence of such a licence, legal amendments to copyright law will be necessary in most jurisdictions to enable text-mining and data-mining research material.

Policy development is still a relatively new activity with respect to research dissemination. Policies may request and encourage provision of Open Access, or they may require it. Evidence shows that only the latter, mandatory, type accumulate high levels of material. Evidence also shows that researchers are happy to be mandated on this issue.

The issues that an Open Access policy should address are as follows:

  + Open Access routes: policies can require "green" Open Access by self-archiving but to preserve authors" freedom to publish where they choose policies should only encourage "gold" Open Access through publication in Open Access journals.

  + Deposit locus: deposit may be required either in institutional or central repositories. Institutional policies naturally specify the former: funder policies may also do this, or may in some cases specify a particular central repository.

  + Content types covered: all policies cover journal articles: policies should also encourage Open Access for books: funder polices are increasingly covering research data outputs.

  + Embargoes: Policies should specify the maximum embargo length permitted and in science this should be 6 months at most: policies should require deposit at the time of publication with the full-text of the item remaining in the repository, but closed, until the end of the embargo period.

  + Permissions: Open Access depends on the permission of the copyright holder, making it vulnerable to publisher interests. To ensure that Open Access can be achieved without problem, sufficient rights to enable that should be retained by the author or employer and publishers assigned a "Licence To Publish". Where copyright is handed to the publisher, Open Access will always depend upon publisher permission and policies must acknowledge this by accommodating a "loophole" for publishers to exploit.

  + Compliance with policies: compliance levels vary according to the strength of the policy and the ongoing support that a policy is given: compliance can be improved by effective advocacy and, where necessary, sanctions.

  + Advocacy to support a policy: there are proven advocacy practices in support of an Open Access policy: policymakers should ensure these are known, understood, and appropriate ones implemented.

  + Sanctions to support a policy: both institutions and funders have sanctions that can be used in support of an Open Access policy: policymakers should ensure that these are identified, understood and appropriate ones implemented where other efforts fail to produce the desired outcome.

  + Waivers: where a policy is mandatory authors may not always be able to comply. A waiver clause is necessary in such policies to accommodate this.

  + "Gold" Open Access: where a funder or institution has a specific commitment with respect to paying "gold" article-processing fees, this should be stated in the policy.

Finally, though this is till very much in its infancy, there
is a move towards developing an Open Bibliography of
science. The premise here is that scientific information
would be much more easily findable were there to be
a properly constructed, fully-open bibliographic service
(currently, the most comprehensive bibliographic services
are paid-for services produced by commercial publishing
companies). Though this issue is nowhere approaching

It is possible to make articles and data open by posting
them on publicly available websites such as research
group site, departmental websites or authors" personal
sites. As well as these examples, there is growing interest
in community websites49, and researchers are increasingly
using these to share articles and other information.

Although these methods do make papers publicly
available, these sites lack the structured metadata
(labelling system) that repositories or Open Access
journals create for each item, and most do not comply
with the internationally-agreed standard OAI-PMH
protocol (see section 2.1). This means that their contents
are not necessarily fully indexed by Web search engines,
which means that their visibility and discoverability are
compromised. Author websites are also commonly out
of date or become obsolete when researchers move
from one institution to another, and they play no reliable
preservation role. Moreover, one of the significant reasons
from the institution or funder viewpoint for having
material in a repository is to create a body of outputs that
can be measured, analysed and assessed. If a repository
is to be used for this purpose then it is important that it
collects all the institution's outputs, rather than having

   + New business models are being developed to service the "open"
     agenda

   + New business models are being developed and tried for Open

    research published by the main Federal agencies would be between 4 and

                                     + Creative Commons licensing is best practice because the system is well-understood, provides a suite of licences that cover all needs, and the licences

While there had been various policy approaches
that involved encouraging Open Access or issuing a
declaration of approval for the concept, the first policy
to have any real effect was the mandatory one adopted
by the School of Electronics & Computer Science at the
University of Southampton, UK, in 2002. This required
authors in that School to place their postprints (the
authors" final version of their peer-reviewed articles) in
the School's repository. It was followed by a similar policy
covering the whole institution at Queensland University of

Table 1: Typology of Open Access policies: main variants in use
Note 1: any of these policies may require libre Open Access, though so far almost all have only required gratis Open Access.
Note 2: Any of these policies may include mention of "gold" Open Access and what the policymaker wishes authors to do in that regard (for
example, the policy may merely encourage authors to publish in Open Access journals or the policymaker may wish to describe a specific fund
made available for this purpose).

                                              + Policy type: policies may request and encourage provision of Open Access, or they may require it. Evidence shows that only the latter, mandatory,
                                                type accumulate high levels of material. Evidence also shows that researchers are happy to be mandated on this issue

                                              + Open Access routes covered: policies can require "green" Open Access by self-archiving but to preserve authors" freedom to publish where they
                                                choose policies should only encourage "gold" Open Access through publication in Open Access journals
Section 8. Policy framework for Open Access




                                              + Deposit locus: deposit may be required either in institutional or central repositories. Institutional policies naturally specify the former: funder
                                                policies may also do this, or may in some cases specify a particular central repository

                                              + Content types covered: all policies cover journal articles: policies should also encourage Open Access for books: funder polices are increasingly
                                                covering research data outputs

                                              + Embargoes: Policies should specify the maximum embargo length permitted and in science this should be 6 months at most: policies should
                                                require deposit at the time of publication with the full-text of the item remaining in the repository, but closed, until the end of the embargo period

                                              + Permissions: Open Access depends on the permission of the copyright holder, making it vulnerable to publisher interests. To ensure that Open
                                                Access can be achieved without problem, sufficient rights to enable that should be retained by the author or employer and publishers assigned
                                                a Licence To Publish. Where copyright is handed to the publisher, Open Access will always depend upon publisher permission and policies must
                                                acknowledge this by accommodating a "loophole" for publishers to exploit

                                              + Compliance with policies: compliance levels vary according to the strength of the policy and the ongoing support that a policy is given:
                                                compliance can be improved by effective advocacy and, where necessary, sanctions

                                              + Advocacy to support a policy: there are proven advocacy practices in support of an Open Access policy: policymakers should ensure these are
                                                known, understood, and appropriate ones implemented

                                              + Sanctions to support a policy: both institutions and funders have sanctions that can be used in support of an Open Access policy: policymakers
                                                should ensure that these are identified, understood and appropriate ones implemented where other efforts fail to produce the desired outcome

                                              + Waivers: where a policy is mandatory authors may not always be able to comply. A waiver clause is necessary in such policies to accommodate this

                                              + "Gold" Open Access: where a funder or institution has a specific commitment with respect to paying "gold" article-processing fees, this should be
                                                stated in the policy

       9.3.9      Embargo period

Institutions may decide to accommodate a short embargo
period after publication before an article can be made
Open Access. The policy should clearly state the length
of the permitted embargo. It should also make clear that
where the publisher's policy requires a longer embargo,




                                                                 Section 9. Summary policy guidelines
authors should publish elsewhere.


       9.3.10 Compliance and sanctions

Since the policy will be mandatory, compliance should
be expected. Evidence suggests, however, that additional
support in terms of advocacy and other measures will be
necessary. University managers may not wish to make
specific threats of sanctions, nor feel they are in a position
to do so. What they can consider is linking the repository
to research assessment and monitoring, thereby
encouraging authors to deposit so that their work is taken
into account in consideration of their chances of tenure or
promotion.

     What should be provided when I have a paper ready
     for publication?

     The final manuscript of the author's research paper
     should be provided. This is the author's own final
     draft, as accepted for journal publication, including all
     modifications resulting from the peer-review process.
     In addition, depositing pre-peer-review preprint drafts
     is welcome, if the author desires early priority and peer
     feedback, but this is of course not a requirement. In some
     cases publishers may permit their own published version,
     either in SGML/XML or PDF, to be provided as well; this too
     is welcome, but not a requirement.

     When should papers be provided?

     An electronic version of the author's final manuscript
     resulting from research supported, in whole or in part,
     by public [or funder name] funding must be deposited
     immediately upon acceptance for publication.

     Will authors still be able to publish in a journal of
     their choice?

     Authors will of course still decide in which journal they
     choose to publish their research papers. They will merely
     have to ensure that a copy of the final, peer-reviewed
     paper is deposited in their institutional repository
     immediately upon acceptance for publication.

     Does the policy apply to all articles?

     The policy applies to all scholarly articles authored or co-
     authored while the person is a [member of the Faculty/
     grant-holder] except for any articles completed before
     the adoption of this policy and any articles for which the
     Faculty member entered into an incompatible licensing or
     assignment agreement before the adoption of this policy.

     Why do we need non-exclusive rights to your article?

     The rights to your article rest with you until you assign
     any or all of them to another party. Under the terms of the
     policy you vest in this institution those rights necessary
     to make the article available on your behalf through the
     repository. Until you vest those rights in the institution, the
     institution cannot act in this way. The institution requires
     only sufficient right to make your work publicly-available:
